# Computing for Mathematics: individual coursework

---

## Instructions

Write a 3 page report on a mathematical topic. Consider the target audience of
your report to be first year mathematics students wanting to learn about a given
topic. Your report is to be written in LaTeX and must use aspects of programming
(Python) to illustrate the particular topic.

For your topic choose a theorem, conjecture or algorithm and use code to
illustrate, prove or disprove it.

*You are encouraged to choose your own topic*, if you do so I recommend checking
with me (Vince Knight) that the topic is appropriate.

## Marking scheme

The following marking scheme will be applied:

- **Code** (50% weighting)
    - 50%: Appropriate code used with concepts learnt in lab sheets.
    - 70%: Code from lab sheets used to demonstrate concepts clearly.
    - 90%: Code used is a combination of code learnt in class and individually researched. Used to explain concepts in a clear and original way.

- **Content** (30% weighting)
    - 50%: The content is correct and basic aspects of the topic are explained.
    - 70%: The content is correct and some research has been undertaken to show interesting aspects of the topic.
    - 90%: The topic chosen is very original and a great understanding is shown.

- **Presentation** (20% weighting)
    - 50%: The work is well written with no or little graphical content and also contains grammatical and spelling mistakes.
    - 70%: The work is well written with some graphs and images and minor grammatical and spelling mistakes.
    - 90%: The work is clear, well written with excellent quality graphs and images with no grammatical and spelling mistakes.

**All code that you want to be considered for marks must be included in the 3
page limit.***

## Example solution

An example solution is available:

- [pdf file]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mock-solution/main.pdf)
- [tex file]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mock-solution/main.tex)
- [bib file]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mock-solution/bibliography.bib)
- [notebook with all code]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mock-solution/main.ipynb)

Note that this is not meant to be a **perfect** solution. In class we will 
discuss it and critique it.
