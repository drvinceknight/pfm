# Computing for Mathematics: individual coursework

## Instructions

Write a 3 page report on a mathematical topic. Consider the target audience of
your report to be first year mathematics students wanting to learn about a given
topic. Your report is to be written in LaTeX and must use aspects of programming
(Python) to illustrate the particular topic.

*You are encouraged to choose your own topic*, if you do so I recommend checking
with me (Vince Knight) that the topic is appropriate. If you are unable to
choose a topic select one from the following:

- Convergence of sequences,
- Complex numbers,
- Solving differential equations,
- Random events in probability.

You are encouraged to include the code used as an appendix.

## Marking scheme

The following marking scheme will be applied:

- **Code** (50% weighting)
    - 50%: Appropriate code used with concepts learnt in lab sheets.
    - 70%: Code from lab sheets used to demonstrate concepts clearly.
    - 90%: Code used is a combination of code learnt in class and individually researched. Used to explain concepts in a clear and original way.

- **Content** (30% weighting)
    - 50%: The content is correct and basic aspects of the topic are explained.
    - 70%: The content is correct and some research has been undertaken to show interesting aspects of the topic.
