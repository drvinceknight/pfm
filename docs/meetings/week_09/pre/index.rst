Pre: LaTeX Refresher + Writing Mathematics
==========================================

Notes
-----

Briefly discuss LaTeX and point students towards https://vknight.org/tex/

**Describe plagiarism**

Ask students to spend 3 minutes discussing what plagiarism is. This should be a
reminder/revision of what was discussed during Library session.

**Writing mathematics**

Ask students to spend 5 minutes reading
`<../../../../assets/pdf/writing-mathematics-guidelines/main.pdf>`_.

Spend 5 minutes in groups discussing principles of mathematical writing.

Spend 10 minutes capturing this on the board.

Some principles might include:


- Know your audience;
- Nudge your reader “with gentle commands”;
- Writing well does not necessarily mean writing more;
- Give a roadmap for long arguments (help your reader);
- Use sentences;
- Use words;
- Use paragraphs;
- Use examples;
- Simplify and refine: until you submit it, it is a draft;
- Don’t follow the guidelines when it’s appropriate not to.

**Highlight that next week we will be peer reviewing other work:**

- First class meeting: review the three example pieces of work
- Last class meeting: peer review draft of each others work

The three examples we will consider can be found here, note that they are not
perfect and we will critically discuss them:

- :download:`sir.pdf <../../../../assets/rsc/sir/main.pdf>`
- :download:`page-rank.pdf <../../../../assets/rsc/page-rank/main.pdf>`
- :download:`monty-hall.pdf <../../../../assets/rsc/monty-hall/main.pdf>`
