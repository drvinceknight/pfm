A diagram showing the relationship between modularity, documentation and
testing.

The modularity leads to increased accuracy of the documentation and makes
testing possible as well as more meaningful.

The documentation leads to being able to identify components of modularity and
clarifies purpose and indicates expected outcomes of testing.

Testing confirms documentation and checks modules together and individually.
