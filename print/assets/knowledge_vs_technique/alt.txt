Knowledge versus technique in this book.

This diagram shows a common mathematical problem in Calculus. This leads to a
description of the Mathematical knowledge needed to solve the problem:

- Need to differentiate a function.
- Need to equate the derivative to 0.
- Need to use the second derivative test.

Finally this leads to two separate ways to do the above: 1 with code and the
other by writing out the mathematics.
