    "- Introduction to basic concepts of programming using Python\n",
    "- Overview of specific concepts relevant to mathematics\n",

    "The course notes are in the form of lab sheets and are all available to you. These are written using Jupyter notebooks (a tool you will learn to use yourself). You will see mathematics and explanations as well as computer code. For example here is some code to raise $2$ to the power of $10$:"

    "- A \"pre\" class meeting: we will discuss and demonstrate the concepts we will learn in any given week.\n",
    "- A lab session: you have the opportunity to get feedback and ask questions on the lab sheets.\n",
    "- A \"post\" class meeting: we will discuss potential difficulties and reaffirm understanding through in class activity.\n",

I recommend you work on those exercises without looking at the solutions. You can ask for feedback and advice in lab sessions and I will also go over specific solutions if required in the post class meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this class requires you to work on the course content outside of contact time. I will not be going over the lab sheets directly in class so I recommend you do those in your own time. At any time you are welcome to view my personal notes for the various meetings we will be having: http://vkcfm.readthedocs.io/\n",

    "    Run the installer.\n",

    "\n",
    "In class activities will often involve you writing some code: if you have a laptop you can use it but it is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Office hours\n",
    "\n",
    "I will hold 2-3 hours a week for office hours during which you may come and get help. Specific hours will be determined collaboratively as a class during the first class meeting.\n",

    "## Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is assessed using an individual piece of coursework. After week 7, this will be the main focus of our work."
