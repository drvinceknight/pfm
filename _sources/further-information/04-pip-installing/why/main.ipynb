    "\n",
    "When using Python for a number of projects it can be beneficial to\n",

    "something called a virtual environment and allows you to have multiple versions\n",

    "\n",
    "Two common ways of using virtual environments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `venv`: this is in the standard Python library.\n",
    "- `conda`: this is a dependency manager that comes with Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about virtual environments at the following links:\n",
