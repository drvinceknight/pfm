    "running code and show how to fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Undefined variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the common mistake of not running the first cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sympy as sym\n",
    "\n",
    "e_to_the_pi = sym.exp(sym.pi)\n",
    "pi_to_the_e = sym.pi ** sym.exp(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the second cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "max(e_to_the_pi, pi_to_the_e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure {ref}`fig:name_error_because_of_not_running_a_cell` shows the error that\n",
    "would occur:\n",

    "Getting a name error when not running a cell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message is specifically telling us that the command `max(e_to_the_pi, pi_to_the_e)` cannot be run because `e_to_the_pi` is not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this we return the first cell and run it before running the second cell\n",

    "### Overwriting a tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common mistake is to run some code that might not be the code that\n",
    "was required.\n",
    "At times this can be overcome by correcting the mistake but on other occasions\n",
    "the code that was run might override and essentially delete something necessary.\n",

    "```\n",

    "**However** the second cell was run with an error (not `max = (…)` as opposed\n",
    "to `max(…)`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "max = (e_to_the_pi, pi_to_the_e)\n",
    "```\n",

    "Getting a type error when the `max` function has been overwritten\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As Figure {ref}`fig:type_error_because_of_overwriting_max` shows the error is\n",
