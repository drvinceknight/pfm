    "# Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "**After** completing the tutorial attempt the following exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are not sure how to do something, have a look at the \"How To\" section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the code written in the [Modularisation Tutorial](modularisation_tutorial) to obtain the average time\n",
    "   until absorption from the first state of the Markov chains with the following transition matrices:\n",
    "   1. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "   2. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 1/4 & 1/4\\\\ 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3  \\\\0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "   3. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 1/2 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "   4. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 1/4 & 1/4\\\\ 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3  \\\\1/5 & 0 & 4/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "2. Modularise the following code by creating a function `flip_coin` that takes a\n",
    "   `probability_of_selecting_heads` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   import random\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def sample_experiment(bag):\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       This samples a token from a given bag and then\n",
    "       selects a coin with a given probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "       If the sampled token is red then the probability\n",
    "       of selecting heads is 4/5 otherwise it is 2/5.\n",
    "\n",
    "       This function returns both the selected token\n",
    "       and the coin face.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       selected_token = random.choice(bag)\n",
    "\n",
    "       if selected_token == \"Red\":\n",
    "           probability_of_selecting_heads = 4 / 5\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           probability_of_selecting_heads = 2 / 5\n",
    "\n",
    "       if random.random() < probability_of_selecting_heads:\n",
    "           coin = \"Heads\"\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           coin = \"Tails\"\n",
    "       return selected_token, coin\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modularise the following code by writing 2 further functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `get_potential_divisors`: A function to return the integers between 2 and\n",
    "     $\\sqrt{N}$ for a given $N$.\n",
    "   - `is_divisor`: A function to check if $n | N$ (\"$n$ divides $N$\") for given\n",
    "     $n, N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "\n",
    "   def is_prime(N):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "       Checks if a number N is prime by checking all that positive integers\n",
    "       numbers less sqrt(N) than it that divide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Note that if N is not a positive integer great than 1 then it does not\n",
    "       check: it returns False.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       if N <= 1 or type(N) is not int:\n",
    "           return False\n",
    "       for potential_divisor in range(2, int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1):\n",
    "           if (N % potential_divisor) == 0:\n",
    "               return False\n",
    "       return True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Confirm your work by comparing to the results of using `sympy.isprime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a `stats.py` file with two functions to implement the calculations of\n",
    "   mean and population variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note that the mean is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "    \\bar x \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The population variance is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "    \\sigma ^ 2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar x) ^ 2}{N}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use your functions to compute the mean and population variance of the following\n",
    "   collections of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. $S_1=(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)$\n",
    "   2. $S_1=(1)$\n",
    "   3. $S_1=(1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Compare your results to the results of using the `statistics.mean`,\n",
    "    and `statistics.pvariance`. Note: the `statistics` library\n",
    "   is part of the standard python library."
