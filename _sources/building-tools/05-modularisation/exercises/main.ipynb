    "**After** completing the tutorial attempt the following exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are not sure how to do something, have a look at the \"How To\" section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the code written in the {ref}`modularisation_tutorial` to obtain the average time\n",
    "   until absorption of the Markov chains with the following transition matrices:\n",
    "   1. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "   2. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 1/4 & 1/4\\\\ 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3  \\\\0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "   3. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 1/2 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "   4. $P = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 1/4 & 1/4\\\\ 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3  \\\\1/5 & 0 & 4/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "2. Modularise the following code by converting it to 2 functions:\n",

    "       Checks if a number N is prime by checking all that positive integers\n",
    "       numbers less sqrt(N) than it that divide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Note that if N is not a positive integer great than 1 then it does not\n",
    "       check: it returns False.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       if N <= 1 or type(N) is not int:\n",
    "           return False\n",

    "           if (N % potential_divisor) == 0:\n",
    "               return False\n",
    "       return True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Confirm your work by comparing to the results of using `sympy.isprime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a `stats.py` file with two functions to implement the calculations of\n",
    "   mean, median and variance of the following collections of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. $S_1=(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)$\n",

    "\n",
    "   Compare your results to the results of using the `statistics.mean`,\n",
    "   `statistics.median` and `statistics.variance`. Note: the `statistics` library\n",
    "   is part of the standard python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a `calculus.py` file with tools to be able to find and qualify (using\n",
    "   the second derivative test) the inflection\n",
    "   points of a given quadratic (assumed to be a Sympy expression)."
