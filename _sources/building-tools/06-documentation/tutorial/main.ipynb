    "##### Brief overview of absorbing markov chains\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain with a given transition matrix $P$ is a system that moves from\n",
    "state to state randomly with the probabilities given by $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",

    "The corresponding Markov chain has 3 states and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P_{11}=1/3$ means that when in state 1 there is a 1/3 chance of staying in\n",
