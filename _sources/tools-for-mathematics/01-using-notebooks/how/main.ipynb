    "# How\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>\n",
    "2. Download the distribution of anaconda for your Operating System\n",
    "3. Run the installer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start a Jupyter notebook server\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a command line tool (`Anaconda prompt` on Windows, `terminal` on OS X);\n",
    "2. Type `jupyter notebook` and press `Enter`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a new notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the location you want using the Jupyter interface;\n",
    "2. Click on the `new` button in the top right;\n",
    "3. Rename the notebook (change `Untitled` in the top left to a name of your choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find/open a notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a file browser you can navigate the directories and files on your computer. Jupyter notebooks appear as generic files with the `.ipynb` extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot double click on these to open them, you need to navigate to them through the Jupyter interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter notebook cell write an instruction, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "3 / 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and click on the `Run` button or use `Shift + Enter` as a keyboard shortcut.\n",
    "\n",
    "(carry_out_basic_arithmetic_operations)=\n",
    "\n",
    "## Carry out basic arithmetic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The python code for the following arithmetic operations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition, $2 + 2$: `2 + 2`;\n",
    "2. Subtraction, $3 - 1$: `3 - 1`;\n",
    "3. Multiplication, $3 \\times 5$: `3 * 5`;\n",
    "4. Division, $20 / 5$: `20 / 5`;\n",
    "5. Exponentiation, $2 ^ 4$: `2 ** 4`;\n",
    "6. Integer remainder, $5 \\mod 2$: `5 % 2`;\n",
    "7. Combining operations, $\\frac{2 ^ 3 + 1}{4}$: `(2 ** 3 + 1) / 4`;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that instructions to a computer (through the code we write) need to be specific. For example the `^` symbol in Python does not mean exponentiation. If you were to type `2 ^ 4` you would get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In later chapters we will see what the specific instructions are to carry out more complex operations.\n",

    "## Write markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "To write markdown click on a cell and change the type to `Markdown`, you can do\n",

    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight \"mark up\" language that allows you to write and\n",
    "include various types of formatting which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Headings;\n",
    "2. Bold and italics;\n",
    "3. Ordered and unordered lists;\n",
    "4. Code (which will only be displayed but not run);\n",
    "5. Hyperlinks\n",

    "- `$ab$` gives $ab$\n",
    "- `$a\\cdot b$` gives $a\\cdot b$\n",
    "- `$a\\times b$` gives $a\\times b$\n",
    "- `$a/b$` gives $a/b$\n",
    "- `$\\frac{a}{b}$` gives $\\frac{a}{b}$\n",
    "- `$a ^ b$` gives $a ^ b$\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$<expression>$` delimiters create what is called an \"inline\" mathematics.\n",
    "You can change the brackets to `$$<expression>$$` to give \"displayed\n",
    "mathematics\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a matrix:\n",
