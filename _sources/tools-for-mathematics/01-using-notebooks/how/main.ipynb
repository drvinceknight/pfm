    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>\n",
    "2. Download the distribution of anaconda for your Operating System\n",
    "3. Run the installer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start a Jupyter notebook server\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a command line tool (`Anaconda prompt` on Windows, `terminal` on OS X);\n",
    "2. Type `jupyter notebook` and press `Enter`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a new notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the location you want using the Jupyter interface;\n",
    "2. Click on the `new` button in the top right;\n",
    "3. Rename the notebook (change `Untitled` in the top left to a name of your choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find/open a notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a file browser you can navigate the directories and files on your\n",

    "In a Jupyter notebook cell write an instruction, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "3 / 5\n",

    "4.  Division, $20 / 5$: `20 / 5`;\n",
    "5.  Exponentiation, $2 ^ 4$: `2 ** 4`;\n",
    "6.  Integer remainder, $5 \\mod 2$: `5 % 2`;\n",
    "7.  Combining operations, $\\frac{2 ^ 3 + 1}{4}$: `(2 ** 3 + 1) / 4`;\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Instructions to a computer (through the code you write)\n",
    "need to be specific. For example the `^` symbol in Python does not mean\n",
