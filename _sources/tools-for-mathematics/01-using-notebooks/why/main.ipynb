    "\n",
    "## Why use anaconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a free and open source piece of software. One of the main\n",
    "reasons for its popularity is that there are a number of separate tools\n",
    "that work well with it, these are called libraries. Sometimes installing\n",
    "these libraries can require an understanding of some potential pitfalls.\n",
    "In scientific circles the Anaconda distribution was developed to give a\n",
    "single download of not only Python but a lot of commonly used libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are are variety of ways to write and run Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Using an interactive notebook environment like Jupyter;\n",
    "2.  Using an integrated development environment and/or editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this book will use an editor. One strength of Jupyter\n",
    "is that it allows you to include communication (writing through\n",
    "markdown) with your code. This allows you to use code and describe what\n",
    "you are using it for. Another advantage is that it allows you to\n",
    "immediately have your output next to your input. There are some\n",
    "limitations to Jupyter as an editor which is why you will explore using\n",
    "a powerful editor in the second part of the course. In general:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Jupyter is a fantastic way to interactively use and communicate\n",
    "    code;\n",
    "2.  Integrated development environments and/or editors are the correct\n",
    "    tools to write software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book you will learn to use either approach in the appropriate\n",
    "manner for the right task. For the first part code will be used\n",
    "interactively and so you will use Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why can I not double click on a Jupyter notebook file?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you double click on a file and your computer opens it in an\n",
    "application that is because a default is set for the particular file\n",
    "extension. For example double clicking on `main.docx` will automatically\n",
    "open up the document using a word processor (like Microsoft word). This\n",
    "is because the file has the extension `.docx` and your operating system\n",
    "has set that anything with that extension will be opened in that\n",
    "particular application. You could also open the application and navigate\n",
    "to the file and open it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Jupyter notebooks no default is set by the operating system as the\n",
    "application that opens it is in fact a local web server in your browser.\n",
    "As such you do not have a choice and need to open it in the Jupyter\n",
    "interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I find keyboard shortcuts for using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "In a notebook if you go to the menu bar and click on `Help` followed by\n",
    "`Keyboard Shortcuts` you will find a number of helpful keyboard\n",
    "shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when on a cell pressing `Esc` followed by `m` will turn the\n",
    "cell in to a markdown cell.\n",

    "## What is markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "As described at <https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/>:\n",

    "> languages\n",

    "## What is LaTeX?\n",
    "\n",
    "As described here <https://www.latex-project.org/about/>:\n",
    "\n",
    "> LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech» (to rhyme with «blech» or\n",
    "> «Bertolt Brecht»), is a document preparation system for high-quality\n",
    "> typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific\n",
    "> documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry\n",
    "> too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting\n",
    "> the right content.\n",

    "(why_do_we_use_brackets_instead_of_dollars_for_latex)=\n",
    "\n",
    "## Can I use `\\(` and `\\)` instead of `$` for LaTeX?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see in some places that `\\(`, `\\)` or `\\[`, `\\]` can be used as\n",
    "delimiters for LaTeX when used outside of Jupyter notebooks. This is in\n",

    "## What is a markup language?\n",
    "\n",
    "LaTeX and markdown are both examples of what is called a **markup\n",
    "language**. Another common example of a markup language is html (the way\n",
    "web pages are written). A markup language is a system that allows us to\n",

    "> like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the\n",
    "> changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a\n",
    "> Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which\n",
    "> words and phrases should look different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general whilst it might take a little while to learn all the\n",
    "intricacies of a markup language it allows for more portability and\n",
    "precision. Markup languages differ in complexity:\n",
