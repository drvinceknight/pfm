    "1. Create the following differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\cos(x)$\n",
    "   2. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 1 - y$\n",
    "   3. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x - 50}{10}$\n",
    "   4. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = y ^2 \\ln (x)$\n",
    "   5. $\\frac{dy}{dx} = (1 + y) ^ 2$\n",

    "3. Obtain the particular solution for the equations in question 1 with\n",
    "   the following particular conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. $y(0) = \\pi$\n",
    "   2. $y(2) = 3$\n",

    "4. The rate of increase of a population ($p$) is equal to 1% of the size of the\n",
    "   population.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Define the differential equation that models this situation.\n",
    "   2. Given that $p(0)=5000$ find the population after 5 time units.\n",

    "   difference between the temperature of the drink ($T$) and the room temperature ($T_R$).\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Define the differential equation that models this situation.\n",
