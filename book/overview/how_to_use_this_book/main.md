# How to use this book

Readers are welcome to use this book in any way they find useful however it is
designed with the following suggestion in mind:

- Start by following along with the tutorial. Carrying out the steps and
  observing the outcomes. It is not expected that a reader gains a deep
  understanding of a given topic when working through the tutorial. The goal
  here is to achieve some level of familiarity.
- After the tutorial, work through the how to section. It is through this
  section that a deeper understanding is to be gained by making connections to
  steps taking in the tutorial. **After working through the how to section it is
  hoped that the reader would understand all steps taken in the tutorial**.
- The exercise section is an opportunity for the reader to practice the topics
  in the how to section. Solutions are available in this section as well.
- After working through those three section it is possible that some readers
  have further questions or would like to find more information about a
  given topic. This is covered in the further information section.

```{attention}
Every chapter will have 4 parts:

- A tutorial: you will be walked through solving a problem. You will be
  specifically told what to do and what to expect.
- A how to section: this will be a shorter more succinct section that will
  detail how to carry out specific things.
- An answers sections: this will be a section with references to further
  resources as well as background information about specific things in the
  chapter and answer to common questions.
- An exercise section: this will be a number of exercises that you can work on.
