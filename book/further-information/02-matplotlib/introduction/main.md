# Matplotlib

Visualisation of data is important in mathematics. This often starts by plotting
a quadratic before using differentiation to find local and global optima but can
then also be expanded to visualise a data set so as to gain further insights.
Python has a powerful library for visualisation called `matplotlib`.
