# Further information.

## Why do we import `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`?

There are actually two different interfaces available to `matplotlib`:

1. Directly using `matplotlib`;
2. Using the slightly simpler functionality available in `matplotlib.pyplot`

Whilst the latter is what has been covered in this book, the former is important
to know for more complex figures.

There is some more information about this available:

1. <https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#matplotlib-pyplot-and-pylab-how-are-they-related>.
2. <https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/>

## Is there a gallery showing off the capabilities of `matplotlib`?

Yes: <https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html>

You can scroll through and click on a picture to see the code that generated it.
