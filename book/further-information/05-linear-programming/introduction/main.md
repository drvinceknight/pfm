# Linear Programming

Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a linear objective function, subject to constraints represented
by linear equations or inequalities. It helps find the best combination of resources to achieve a goal while satisfying
limitations, like a puzzle where you have to find the best way to use limited pieces to solve it.

In this chapter we will cover:

- How to use `scipy` to solve linear programming problems.
