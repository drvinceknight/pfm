Python is not renowned for its run speed but its speed of writing.
`numpy` helps with this at is brings fast numeric computations to Python. It is
also powerful tool for linear algebra (matrices) although it cannot handle
symbolic variables.

```{important}
In this chapter we will cover:

- How to create and manipulate `numpy` arrays.
- How to create specific `numpy` arrays like linear spaces.
- How to use `numpy`'s random number generator.
- How to invert a matrix.
- How to fit a polynomial to data.
```
