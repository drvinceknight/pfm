# Algebra

## Introduction

A typical secondary school curriculum includes Algebra which is
described, in the A-level syllabus as:

> "Algebra: this is an essential tool which supports and expresses
> mathematical reasoning and provides a means to generalise across a
> number of contexts."

In practice this often means:

- Manipulating numeric expressions;
- Manipulating symbolic expressions;
- Solving equations.

You can use a computer to carry out some of these techniques.

```{important}
This chapter covers:

-   Manipulating numeric and symbolic expressions.
-   Solving equations.
