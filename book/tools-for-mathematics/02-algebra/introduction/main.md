## Introduction

As of 2020, the British A-level syllabus includes Algebra which
is described as:

> reasoning and provides a means to generalise across a number of contexts.

In practice this often means:

- Manipulating numeric expressions;
- Manipulating symbolic expressions;
- Solving equations.

You can use a computer to carry out some of these techniques.
