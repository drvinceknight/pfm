# Exercises

**After** completing the tutorial attempt the following exercises.

**If you are not sure how to do something, have a look at the "How To" section.**

1. Simplify the following expressions:
    1. $\frac{3}{\sqrt{3}}$
    2. $\frac{2 ^ {78}}{2 ^ {12}2^{-32}}$
    3. $8^0$
    4. $a^4b^{-2}+a^{3}b^{2}+a^{4}b^0$
2. Solve the following equations:
    1. $x + 3 = -1$
    2. $3 x ^ 2 - 2 x = 5$
    3. $x (x - 1) (x + 3) = 0$
    4. $4 x ^3 + 7x - 24 = 1$
3. Consider the equation: $x ^ 2 + 4 - y = \frac{1}{y}$:
    1. Find the solution to this equation for $x$.
    2. Obtain the specific solution when $y = 5$. Do this in two ways:
       substitute the value in to your equation and substitute the value in to
       your solution.
4. Consider the quadratic: $f(x)=4x ^ 2 + 16x + 25$:
    1. Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation $4x ^ 2 + 16x + 25 =
     0$. What does this tell us about the solutions to the equation? What
     does this tell us about the graph of $f(x)$?
    2. By completing the square, show that the minimum point of $f(x)$ is
     $\left(-2, 9\right)$
5. Consider the quadratic: $f(x)=-3x ^ 2 + 24x - 97$:
    1. Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation $-3x ^ 2 + 24x - 97 =
     0$. What does this tell us about the solutions to the equation? What
     does this tell us about the graph of $f(x)$?
    2. By completing the square, show that the maximum point of $f(x)$ is
     $\left(4, -49\right)$
6. Consider the function $f(x) = x^ 2 + a x + b$.
    1. Given that $f(0) = 0$ and $f(3) = 0$ obtain the values of $a$ and $b$.
    2. By completing the square confirm that graph of $f(x)$ has a line of symmetry at $x=\frac{3}{2}$
