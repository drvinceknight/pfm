# Calculus

As of 2020, the A-level syllabus includes Calculus which
<https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/415060-2020-2022-syllabus.pdf>
describes as:

> Calculus: this is a fundamental element which describes change in dynamic
> situations and underlines the links between functions and graphs.

In practice this often means:

- taking limits of functions;
- differentiating functions;
- integrating functions.

Here we will see how to instruct a computer to carry out these techniques.

```{important}
In this chapter we will cover:

- Taking limits.
- Differentiating functions.
- Computing definite and indefinite integrals.
```
