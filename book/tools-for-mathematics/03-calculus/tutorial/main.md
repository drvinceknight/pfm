# Tutorial

We will solve the following problem using a computer to assist with the technical aspects:

```{admonition} Problem

Consider the function $f(x)= \frac{24 x \left(a - 4 x\right) + 2 \left(a - 8 x\right) \left(b - 4 x\right)}{\left(b - 4 x\right)^{4}}$

1. Given that $\frac{df}{dx}|_{x=0}=0$, $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}|_{x=0}=-1$ and that $b>0$ find the values of $a$ and $b$.
2. For the specific values of $a$ and $b$ find:
    1. $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)$;
    2. $\lim_{x\to \infty}f(x)$;
    3. $\int f(x) dx$;
    4. $\int_{5}^{20} f(x) dx$.

```

Sympy is once again the library we will use for this.

We will start by creating a variable `expression` that has the value of the expression of $f(x)$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import sympy as sym

x = sym.Symbol("x")
a = sym.Symbol("a")
b = sym.Symbol("b")
expression = (24 * x * (a - 4 * x) + 2 * (a - 8 * x) * (b - 4 * x)) / ((b - 4 * x) ** 4)
expression
```

now we can will use `sympy.diff` to calculate the derivative. This tool takes two inputs:

- the first is the expression we are differentiating. Essentially this is the numerator of $\frac{df}{dx}$.
- the first is the variable we are differentiating for. Essentially this is the denominator of $\frac{df}{dx}$.

```{attention}
We have imported `import sympy as sym` so we are going to write `sym.diff`:
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
derivative = sym.diff(expression, x)
derivative
```

Let us factorise that to make it slightly clearer:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.factor(derivative)
```

We will now create the first equation, which is obtained by substituting $x=0$
in to the value of the derivative and equating that to $0$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
first_equation = sym.Eq(derivative.subs({x: 0}), 0)
first_equation
```

We will factor that equation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.factor(first_equation)
```

Now we are going to create the second equation, substituting $x=0$ in to the
value of the second derivative. We calculate the second derivative by passing a
third (optional) input to `sym.diff`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
second_derivative = sym.diff(expression, x, 2)
second_derivative
```

We equate this expression to $-1$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
second_equation = sym.Eq(second_derivative.subs({x: 0}), -1)
second_equation
```

Now to solve the first equation to obtain a value for $a$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.solveset(first_equation, a)
```

Now to substitute that value for $a$ and solve the second equation for $b$:

```{code-cell} ipython3
second_equation = second_equation.subs({a: b / 3})
second_equation
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.solveset(second_equation, b)
```

Recalling the question we know that $b>0$ thus: $b = 2\sqrt{2}\sqrt[4]{3}$ and
$a=\frac{2\sqrt{2}\sqrt[4]{3}}{3}$.

We will substitute these values back and finish the question:

```{code-cell} ipython3
expression = expression.subs(
    {a: 2 * sym.sqrt(2) * sym.root(3, 4) / 3, b: 2 * sym.sqrt(2) * sym.root(3, 4)}
)
expression
```

```{attention}
We are using the `sym.root` command for the generic $n$th root.
```

We can confirm our findings:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.diff(expression, x).subs({x: 0})
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.diff(expression, x, 2).subs({x: 0})
```

Now we will calculate the limits using `sym.limit`, this takes 3 inputs:

- The expression we are taking the limit of.
- The variable that is changing.
- The value that the variable is tending towards.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.limit(expression, x, 0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.limit(expression, x, sym.oo)
```

Now we are going to calculate the **indefinite** integral using
`sympy.integrate`. This tool takes 2 inputs as:

- the first is the expression we're integrating. This is the $f$ in $\int_a^b f
  dx$.
- the second is the remaining information needed to calculate the integral: $x$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.factor(sym.integrate(expression, x))
```

If we want to calculate a **definite** integral then instead of passing the
single variable we pass a tuple which contains the variable as well as the
bounds of integration:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sym.factor(sym.integrate(expression, (x, 5, 20)))
```
