# Exercises

**After** completing the tutorial attempt the following exercises.

**If you are not sure how to do something, have a look at the "How To" section.**

1. Obtain the following tuples using the `range` command:
   1. $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$
   2. $(2, 3, 4, 5)$
   3. $(2, 4, 6, 8)$
   4. $-1, 2, 5, 8$
2. By **both** generating and directly computing obtain the **number of** the following:
   1. All permutations of $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$.
   2. All permutations of $("A", "B", "C")$.
   3. Permutations of size 3 of $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$.
   4. Permutations of size 2 of $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)$.
   5. Combinations of size 3 of $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$.
   6. Combinations of size 2 of $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$.
   7. Combinations of size 5 of $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$.
3. A class consists of 3 students from Ashville and 4 from Bewton. A committee of 5 students is chosen at random the class.
   1. Find the number of committees that include 2 students from Ashville and 3 from Bewton are chosen.
   2. In fact 2 students, from Ashville and 3 from Bewton are chosen. In order to watch a video, all 5 committee members sit in a row. In how many different orders can they sit if no two students from Bewton sit next to each other.
4. Three letters are selected at random from the 8 letters of the word `COMPUTER`, without regard to order.
   1. Find the number of possible selections of 3 letters.
   2. Find the number of selections of 3 letters with the letter `P`.
   3. Find the number of selections of 3 letters where the 3 letters form the word `TOP`.
