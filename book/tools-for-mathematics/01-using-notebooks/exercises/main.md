   2. $3 / 7$
   3. $456 / 21$
   4. $\frac{4 ^ 3 + 2}{2\times 5} - 5 ^ {\frac{1}{2}}$
3. Write a markdown cell with the following and view the rendered version:

   # Euler's equation

   \\[
   e ^ {i\pi} = -1
   \\]
   ```

4. Render the following expressions by writing markdown

   2. $- 5 ^ {\frac{1}{2}}$
   3. $\frac{df}{dx}$
   4. $\int_{5}^{12}x^2dx$
   5. $\begin{pmatrix}4 & 12 & 3\\2 & x & i\\\end{pmatrix}$
5. Save your notebook to `HTML` and open and view it.
