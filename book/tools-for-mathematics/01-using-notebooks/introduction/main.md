# Using notebooks

## Introduction

At the advent of Calculus two mathematicians are credited with its
formalisation/invention:

- Isaac Newton

- Gottfried Leibniz

One of the differences between the approaches taken by Newton and
Leibniz is their notation. Newton denoted the derivative of a function
$f$ as:

$$Df$$

Leibniz denoted the derivative with the now more commonly used notation:
$$\frac{df}{dx}$$

The mathematics itself is unchanged: what changes is the
language/notation used to communicate it. Similarly when giving
instructions through code to a computer there are a number of notations,
more commonly called languages available. This book will be using a
language called **Python**. Python was originally designed as a teaching
language but it is now popular both in academia and in industry.

In this chapter you will cover:

-   Installing the specific distribution of Python on your computer.
-   Using something called a Jupyter notebook to write and run Python
    code.
-   Writing descriptive notes using `markdown`{.markdown} and LaTeX
    (pronounced Lay-tech).
```
