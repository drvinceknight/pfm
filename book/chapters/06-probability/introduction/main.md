# Probability

Probability is the study of random events. Computers are particularly helpful
here as they can be used to carry out a number of experiments to confirm and/or
explore theoretic results.

> a group of numbers or other symbols arranged in a rectangle that can be used
> together as a single unit to solve particular mathematical problems

In practice studying probability will often involve:

- calculating expected chances of an event occurring;
- calculating the conditional chances of an event occurring given another event
  occurring.

Here we will see how to instruct a computer to sample such events.

```{important}
In this chapter we will cover:

- Generating random numbers.
- Randomly sample from a given collection of items.
- Write python functions to be able to repeat experiments.
```
