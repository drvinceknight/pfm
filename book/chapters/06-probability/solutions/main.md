# Solutions

## Question 1

> `1`. Simulate the probability of an event occurring with the following chances:

>   `1`. $\frac{2}{7}$


    2. $\frac{1}{10}$
    3.  $\frac{1}{100}$
    4.  $1$
2. Simulate the probability of selecting a red token from each of the following configurations:
    1. A bag with 4 red tokens and 4 green tokens.
    2. A bag with 4 red tokens, 4 green tokens and 10 yellow tokens.
    3. A bag with 0 red tokens, 4 green tokens and 10 yellow tokens.
3. An experiment consists of selecting a token from a bag and spinning a coin. The bag contains 3 red tokens and 4 blue tokens. A token is selected at random from the bag, its colour is noted and then the token is returned to the bag.

    When a red token is selected, a biased coin with probability $\frac{4}{5}$ of landing heads is spun.

    When a blue token is selected, a biased coin with probability $\frac{2}{5}$ of landing heads is spun.

    1. What is the probability of picking a red token?
    2. What is the probability of obtaining Heads?
    3. If a heads is obtained, what is the probability of having selected a red token.
4. On a randomly chose day, the probability of an individual travelling to school by car, bicycle or on foot is $1/2$, $1/6$ and $1/3$ respectively. The probability of being late when using these methods of travel is $1/5$, $2/5$ and $1/10$ respectively.

    1. Find the probability that an individual travels by foot and is late.
    2. Find the probability that an individual is not late.
    3. Given that an individual is late, find the probability that they did not travel on foot.
