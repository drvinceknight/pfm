## Introduction

As of 2020, the A-level syllabus includes Algebra which
https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/415060-2020-2022-syllabus.pdf
describes as:

> Algebra: this is an essential tool which supports and expresses mathematical
> reasoning and provides a means to generalise across a number of contexts.

In practice this often means:

- Manipulating numeric expressions;
- Manipulating symbolic expressions;
- Solving equations.

We can use a computer to carry out some of these techniques.
