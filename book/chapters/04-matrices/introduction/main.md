# Matrices

Matrices form the building block of an area of mathematics referred to as Linear
Algebra. The dictionary definition of a matrix is:

> a group of numbers or other symbols arranged in a rectangle that can be used
> together as a single unit to solve particular mathematical problems

The specific mathematical problems discussed usually correspond to solving large
systems of linear equations. However they have become an area of interest in
their own right and manipulating matrices usually corresponds to:

- calculating the determinant of a matrix;
- calculating the inverse of a matrix.

Here we will see how to instruct a computer to carry out these techniques.
