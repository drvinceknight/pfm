# Object oriented programming

In the first part of this book we covered a number of tools that allow us to
carry out mathematical techniques. One example of this is the `sympy.Symbol`
object that create a symbolic variable that can be manipulated. In this chapter
we will see how to define similar mathematical objects.

```{important}
In this chapter we will cover:

- Creating objects.
- Giving objects attributes.
- Defining methods on objects.
- Inheriting new objects from others.
```
