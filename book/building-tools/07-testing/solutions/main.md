# Solutions

**After** completing the tutorial attempt the following exercises.

**If you are not sure how to do something, have a look at the "How To" section.**

> Write tests for the `statistics.py` file written in the exercises of
> [Modularisation Exercises](modularisation_exercises).

We start by writing the tests for the code. The following is in a
`test_stats.py` file:

```py
import stats


def test_get_mean():
    """
    This tests the `get_mean` function for a small iterable
    """
    iterable = (1, 2, 3)
    assert stats.get_mean(iterable) == 2


def test_get_population_variance():
    """
    This tests the `get_population_variance` function for a small iterable
    """
    iterable = (1, 2, 3)
    assert round(stats.get_population_variance(iterable), 3) == 0.667


test_get_mean()
test_get_population_variance()
```

Next to test the documentation we modify the code snippets in the documentation
written in [Documentation Exercises](documentation_exercises) so that it
becomes the following which we put in a file called `README.md`:

# Stats

Functionality for basic statistical operations.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial we will see how to use `stats.py` to compute the mean and
population variance of the following set of data:

```
x = (1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 54, 5, 6, 70, 10, 12, 10)
```

First we import the library:


```python
>>> import stats

```

Next let us define the data:

```python
>>> x = (1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 54, 5, 6, 70, 10, 12, 10)

```

To view the mean we use `stats.get_mean`:

```python
>>> round(stats.get_mean(x), 5)
12.06667

```

To view the population variance we use `stats.get_population_variance`:

```python
>>> round(stats.get_population_variance(x), 5)
404.46222

```

## How to guide

### How to compute a mean

To compute a mean we use `stats.get_mean`:

```python
>>> import stats
>>> stats.get_mean((1, 2, 3, 4))
2.5

```

### How to compute population variance

To compute a mean we use `stats.get_population_variance`:

```python
>>> import stats
>>> stats.get_population_variance((1, 2, 3, 4))
1.25

```

## Explanation

The mean is calculated using the following formula:

$$
 \bar x \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}
$$


The population variance is defined by:

$$
 \sigma ^ 2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar x) ^ 2}{N}
$$

Note that the population variance differs from the sample variance.

## Reference

### List of functionality

The following functions are written in `absorption`:

- `get_mean`
- `get_population_variance`

### Bibliography

The wikipedia page on the mean and population variance gives a good overview of the
topic:

- Mean: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean#Arithmetic_Mean_(AM)>
- Population variance: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Population_variance>
