# Tutorial

In this tutorial we will write code to ensure the correctness of the software we
have written in {ref}`modularisation_tutorial` and
{ref}`documentation`.

The software for `absorption.py` is in fact across two separate files:

- `absorption.py`: the source code. We will check this using _unit tests_
- `README.md`: the documentation. We will check this using _doc tests_.

We will show how to write code that checks both of these.

## Writing tests for code

Recalling the code written in `absorption.py` in {ref}`modularisation_tutorial`,
there are 4 functions that need to be validated:

- `get_long_run_state`
- `extract_Q`
- `compute_N`
- `compute_t`

In the directory that contains `absorption.py` we will now create a new Python
script called: `test_absorption.py`.

We will write some functions in there to validate each of the functions in
`absorption.py`:

```py
import numpy as np

import absorption

def test_long_run_state_for_known_number_of_states():
    """
    This tests the `long_run_state` for a small example matrix
    """
    pi = np.array([1, 0, 0])
    P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
    pi_after_5_steps = absorption.get_long_run_state(pi=pi, k=5, P=P)
    assert np.array_equal(pi_after_5_steps, pi @ np.linalg.matrix_power(P, 5)), "Did not get expected result for pi after 5 steps"


def test_long_run_state_when_starting_in_absorbing_state():
    """
    This tests the `long_run_state` for a small example matrix.

    In this test we start in the absorbing state, the state vector should not
    change.
    """
    pi = np.array([0, 0, 1])
    P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
    pi_after_5_steps = absorption.get_long_run_state(pi=pi, k=5, P=P)
    assert np.array_equal(pi_after_5_steps, pi)


test_long_run_state_for_known_number_of_states()
test_long_run_state_when_starting_in_absorbing_state()
```

```{tip}
The two functions we have written do not include a `return` statement but
instead include an `assert` statement. An `assert` is followed by two values
separated by a comma:

1. A boolean that is to be `True` or `False`.
2. A string that is output if the boolean is `False.
```

To run those tests we will run the script at the command line:

```bash
$ python test_absorption.py
```

When running the tests if everything has been done correctly there will be no
output: the 2 functions we have written have been called and the assertions have
_passed_. See Figure {ref}`fig:running_tests_with_no_errors`.

```


For each of the four functions in `absorption.py` we can now add further tests
and ensure they are also called at the end. The full `test_absorption.py` file
should look like:

```py
import numpy as np

import absorption

def test_long_run_state_for_known_number_of_states():
    """
    This tests the `long_run_state` for a small example matrix
    """
    pi = np.array([1, 0, 0])
    P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
    pi_after_5_steps = absorption.get_long_run_state(pi=pi, k=5, P=P)
    assert np.array_equal(pi_after_5_steps, pi @ np.linalg.matrix_power(P, 5)), "Did not get expected result for pi after 5 steps"


def test_long_run_state_when_starting_in_absorbing_state():
    """
    This tests the `long_run_state` for a small example matrix.

    In this test we start in the absorbing state, the state vector should not
    change.
    """
    pi = np.array([0, 0, 1])
    P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
    pi_after_5_steps = absorption.get_long_run_state(pi=pi, k=5, P=P)
    assert np.array_equal(pi_after_5_steps, pi)


def test_extract_Q():
    """
    This tests that the submatrix Q can be extracted from a given matrix P.
    """
    P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
    Q = absorption.extract_Q(P)
    expected_Q = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3]])
    assert np.array_equal(Q, expected_Q), f"The expected Q did not match, the code obtained {Q}"


def test_compute_N():
    """
    This tests the computation of the fundamental matrix N
    """
    P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
    Q = absorption.extract_Q(P)
    N = absorption.compute_N(Q)
    expected_N = np.array([[8 / 3, 1], [4 / 3, 2]])
    assert np.allclose(N, expected_N), f"The expected N did not match, the code obtained {N}"


def test_compute_t():
    """
    This tests the computation of the number of steps until absorption t.
    """
    P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
    t = absorption.compute_t(P)
    expected_t = np.array([11 / 3, 10 / 3])
    assert np.allclose(t, expected_t), f"The expected t did not match, the code obtained {t}"


test_long_run_state_for_known_number_of_states()
test_long_run_state_when_starting_in_absorbing_state()
test_extract_Q()
test_compute_N()
test_compute_t()
```

```{tip}
The `numpy.array_equal` and `numpy_allclose` allow us to compare equality of
boolean arrays. They return `True` or `False` depending on whether the two
passed arrays are equal or approximately equal (respectively).

`numpy.allclose` should be used when comparing numpy arrays that might be
different due to numerical imprecision.
```

**You can experiment by changing some of the code or the tests and see the way
the tests fail.** See Figure {ref}`fig:running_tests_with_error_in_source_code`
where the following specific error has been introduced in to `absorption.py`:
`P.diagonal() == 1` is incorrect and should be `P.diagonal() != 1`.

Running the tests with an error in the source code.
```

As and when we add more features to `absorption.py` we will also add tests.

Software is compromised of both code and documentation. So far we have tested
our code, now we will test our documentation.

## Testing documentation

To ensure the python code written in documentation (see {ref}`documentation`) is
correct we need to write the code using a specific format:

- `>>>` to denote python code
- `...` to denote secondary lines of multi line python code.
- Nothing to denote the expected output.

As an example, in {ref}`documentation`, we had written:

````md
```python
import numpy as np

import absorption

pi = np.array([1, 0, 0])
P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])
```

We now see how the vector $\pi$ changes over time:

```python
for k in range(10):
    print(absorption.get_long_run_state(pi, k, P))
```

This will give:

```
[1. 0. 0.]
[0.5  0.25 0.25]
[0.33333333 0.20833333 0.45833333]
[0.23611111 0.15277778 0.61111111]
[0.16898148 0.1099537  0.72106481]
[0.12114198 0.0788966  0.79996142]
[0.08686986 0.05658436 0.85654578]
[0.06229638 0.04057892 0.8971247 ]
[0.0446745 0.0291004 0.9262251]
[0.03203738 0.02086876 0.94709386]

```
````

We will modify the above to be:

````md
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import absorption
>>> pi = np.array([1, 0, 0])
>>> P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])

```

We now see how the vector $\pi$ changes over time:

```python
>>> for k in range(10):
...     print(absorption.get_long_run_state(pi, k, P))
[1. 0. 0.]
[0.5  0.25 0.25]
[0.33333333 0.20833333 0.45833333]
[0.23611111 0.15277778 0.61111111]
[0.16898148 0.1099537  0.72106481]
[0.12114198 0.0788966  0.79996142]
[0.08686986 0.05658436 0.85654578]
[0.06229638 0.04057892 0.8971247 ]
[0.0446745 0.0291004 0.9262251]
[0.03203738 0.02086876 0.94709386]

```
````


To test the documentation gives the results that are written, run the following
at the command line:

```bash
$ python -m doctest README.md
```

When testing the documentation, as for the testing of code, if there are no
errors there will be no output as shown in
{ref}`fig:running_doctests_with_no_errors`.

```{figure} ./img/running_doctests_with_no_errors/main.png
---
width: 75%
name: fig:running_doctests_with_no_errors
---
Running the doctests with no errors.
```

Similarly to testing the code, if we include an error in the documentation an
error will be displayed when running the doc tests. This is shown in
{ref}`fig:running_doctests_with_an_error` where the final output has been
changed to include an error: `-1` is written instead of `0.94709386`.

# Absorption

Functionality to study the absorbing Markov chains.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial we will see how to use `absorption` to study an absorbing
Markov chain. For some background information on absorbing Markov chains we
recommend: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbing_Markov_chain>.

Given a transition matrix $P$ defined by:

$$
p = \begin{pmatrix}
   1/2 & 1/4 & 1/4\\
   1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3\\
   0   & 0   & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

We will start by seeing how the chain evolves over time by starting with an
initial vector $\pi=(1,0,0)$. In the next code snippet we will import the
necessary libraries and create both $P$ and $\pi$:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import absorption
>>> pi = np.array([1, 0, 0])
>>> P = np.array([[1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4], [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 0, 1]])

```

We now see how the vector $\pi$ changes over time:

```python
>>> for k in range(10):
...     print(absorption.get_long_run_state(pi, k, P))
[1. 0. 0.]
[0.5  0.25 0.25]
[0.33333333 0.20833333 0.45833333]
[0.23611111 0.15277778 0.61111111]
[0.16898148 0.1099537  0.72106481]
[0.12114198 0.0788966  0.79996142]
[0.08686986 0.05658436 0.85654578]
[0.06229638 0.04057892 0.8971247 ]
[0.0446745 0.0291004 0.9262251]
[0.03203738 0.02086876 0.94709386]

```

We see that, as expected over time the probability of being in the third state,
which is absorbing, increases.

We can also use `absorption` to get the average number of steps until
absorption from each state:

```python
>>> absorption.compute_t(P)
array([3.66666667, 3.33333333])

```

We see that the expected amounts of steps from the first state is slightly more
than from the second.

Here is the modified how to guide:

## How to guides

### How to compute the long run state of a system after a given number of steps

Given a transition matrix $P$ and a state vector $\pi$, the state of the system
after $k$ steps is given by:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import absorption
>>> pi = np.array([0, 1, 0])
>>> P = np.array([[1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 2], [0, 0, 1]])
>>> absorption.get_long_run_state(pi=pi, k=10, P=P)
array([0.0019552, 0.0019552, 0.9960896])

```

### How to extract the transitive state transition sub matrix $Q$

Given a transition matrix $P$, the sub matrix $Q$ that
corresponds to the transitions between transitive (i.e. not absorbing) states can
be extracted:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import absorption
>>> P = np.array([[1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 1, 0], [1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 2]])
>>> absorption.extract_Q(P=P)
array([[0.33333333, 0.33333333],
       [0.25      , 0.5       ]])

```

### How to compute the fundamental matrix $N$

Given a transition matrix $P$, the fundamental matrix $N$
can be obtained:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import absorption
>>> P = np.array([[1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 1, 0], [1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 2]])
>>> Q = absorption.extract_Q(P=P)
>>> absorption.compute_N(Q=Q)
array([[2.        , 1.33333333],
       [1.        , 2.66666667]])

```

### How to compute the average steps until absorption

Given a transition matrix $P$ and a state vector $\pi$, the average number of
steps until absorption from all states can be obtained:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import absorption
>>> P = np.array([[1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3], [0, 1, 0], [1 / 4, 1 / 4, 1 / 2]])
>>> absorption.compute_t(P=P)
array([3.33333333, 3.66666667])

```

## Documenting the tests

Finally it is important to document how to run the tests. The _reference_
section is an appropriate place to put this. We will add the following to the
`README.md` file:

````md
### Testing the software

To test the code:

```
$ python test_absorption.py
```

To test the documentation:

```
$ python -m doctest README.md
```
````
