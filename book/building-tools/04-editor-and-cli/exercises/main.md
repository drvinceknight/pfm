# Exercises

**After** completing the tutorial attempt the following exercises.

**If you are not sure how to do something, have a look at the "How To" section.**


1. Use the REPL (read eval print loop) to carry out the following calculations:

   1. $3 + 8$
   2. $3 / 7$
   3. $456 / 21$
   4. $\frac{4 ^ 3 + 2}{2\times 5} - 5 ^ {\frac{1}{2}}$

2. Install the Python plugin for VScode.
3. Use the command line and a python script written in VScode to solve the
   following problems:

   1. Find the solutions to the following equation: $x ^ 2 - 3 x + 2 = 1$.
   2. Differentiate the following function: $f(x) = \cos(x) / 4$
   3. Find the determinant of $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 / 5 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$.
   4. Count the number of ways of picking 2 letters from "ABCD" where order
      does not matter.
   5. Simulate the probability of picking a red token from a bag with 3 red
      rokens, 5 blue tokens and a yellow token.
   6. Obtain the first 5 terms of the sequence defined by:

      $$
        \left\{
            \begin{array}{l}
              a_0 = 0,\\
              a_1 = 2,\\
              a_n = 3 a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2}, n \geq 2
            \end{array}
        \right.
      $$
4. Install the `Markdown all in one` plugin for markdown in VScode and then:
   1. Create a new file `main.md`.
   2. Write some basic markdown in it.
   3. Use the plugin to preview the rendered markdown.
