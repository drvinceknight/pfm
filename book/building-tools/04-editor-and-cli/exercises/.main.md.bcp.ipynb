    "    1. Find the solutions to the following equation: $x ^ 2 - 3 x + 2 = 1$.\n",
    "    2. Differentiate the following function: $f(x) = \\cos(x) / 4$\n",
    "    3. Find the determinant of $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 / 5 & 1\\\\1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",

    "3. Install the Python plugin for VScode.\n",
    "4. Install the `Markdown all in one` plugin for markdown in VScode.\n",
    "    1. Create a new file `main.md`.\n",
    "    2. Write some basic markdown in it.\n",
    "    3. Use the plugin to preview the rendered markdown."
