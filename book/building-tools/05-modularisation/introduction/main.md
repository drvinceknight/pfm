# Modularisation

This is the first of three chapters that aim to move from writing code
that works to writing software. In this particular chapter we will consider how
to write our code in a structured way.

```{important}
In this chapter we will cover:

- Importing code from python files.
- Fragmenting code in to modular pieces.
```
