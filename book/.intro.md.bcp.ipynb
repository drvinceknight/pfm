    "\n",
    "This is akin to teaching someone how to forge metal so as to make a nail and\n",

    "1. Tools for mathematics;\n",
    "2. Building tools.\n",

    "- Algebraic manipulation\n",
    "- Calculus (differentiation and integration)\n",
    "- Permutations and combinations\n",
    "- Probability\n",
    "- Linear algebra\n",

    "The questions we will tackle will be familiar in their presentation and\n",
    "description. **What will be different** is that no **by hand** calculations will\n",
